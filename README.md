# CS_Project

This is a Repository Pattern type simple Gym Management System using C# programming language. The system allowed gym owners to manage their gym memberships, classes, trainers, and clients. The Repository Pattern was used to abstract the data access layer and centralize data access logic, which made it easier to maintain and modify the application. Overall, this project demonstrated the benefits of using the Repository Pattern in software development, and how it can improve code organization and maintainability.
